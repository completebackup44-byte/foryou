      i often regret how little i talk to you when times are tough and i imagine that you are opening this during one of these times. I know when
      i get stressed im not the kindest person nor the most sociable nor the easiest. I often worry that you do not know how much i appreciate you.
      when i get overwhelmed i tend to withdraw and sometimes i even take out my stress on you when you voice your concerns. but even though i seem
      cold and dismissive and i know that you could easily find others who are much better than me, you stay by my side and even though i suck at showing
      it i am grateful. i love you
      `,

      `
      i know youd rather talk to me in person and i know i would too but for now i hope this short letter is enough. i hope you don't just read them all in one day
      and truly savour these. as writing lots of short letters isn't an easy feat lol. if you're reading this when you are genuinely sad then i have a video that might
      cheer you up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur48jVNNlKk

      im going to try write a love letter and it may or may not be cringe and a little jarring. i know you arent thrilled that you're not my first so i
      decided to write a bittersweet letter about it
      
      you weren’t my first choice.
      i would never say that to you. it’s hard to imagine making my choice again.
      
      fate brought you to me randomly, and somehow the stars had me in your home. after a day of cuddling, i did my usual pathetic, awkward attempt for a kiss.
      
      so then i tried again, and after a week (it must have been), by holding your hand and smiling, i knew you were something special.
      
      i’ve hit my usual bumps these last few months. you’ve seen every woe i’ve thrown, but where others left and said goodbye, you stayed with me time and time again.
      
      there’s another world, i’m sure, with tiny waists and bigger breasts, but pity them all. for me, you beat the rest.
      
      so while it’s true you weren’t my first,
      
      you were the best choice of my life <3

      i love you
      `,

      you don’t have to be cheerful to be loved. you don’t have to be productive to be worth it. you don’t have to look perfect to be wanted. 
      you’re allowed to be a mess in my arms. you’re allowed to cry and not explain it properly. you’re allowed to have heavy days.
      i still want you on the heavy days.
      i want a life with you that’s soft and real. mornings where you’re sleepy, afternoons where we do nothing important, nights where i get to hold you until your breathing changes and i can feel you calm down.
      and when you’re sad i want you to remember this part the most
      i’m not going anywhere. i’m yours. even when you don’t feel like yourself. even when you don’t feel pretty. even when you don’t feel lovable.
      especially then.
      `,

      `
      if you’re reading this while you’re sad or doubting yourself, i need you to listen to me for a second
      you don’t get to talk about yourself like you’re not stunning. not when i’ve seen you. not when you do that thing where you’re just existing and somehow it’s the hottest thing in the room.
      i don’t care what your brain is trying to tell you right now. my body reacts to you before my thoughts even catch up. you could be in the most simple outfit, hair not done, no makeup, and i’d still look at you and immediately want to pull you into me.
      and i mean want
      i mean i want to pin you to my attention. i want you close enough that you can feel how serious i am about you. i want to kiss you slow at first, just to make you stop thinking, just to make you remember you’re not hard to love.
      then i want to kiss you like i’ve been behaving all day and i’m finally alone with the only person i actually want. i want my hands on you, not in a rushed way, in a “i’m taking my time because i’m obsessed” way. i want you to feel wanted so clearly that you don’t have room left for insecurity.
      if you were here, i’d hold your face and make you look at me and i’d tell you, quiet and close, that you’re not allowed to hide from me. not emotionally, not physically. i’d remind you that you’re mine in the way that feels safe, the way that makes your shoulders drop, the way that makes you exhale.
      and i’d be gentle with your heart the whole time
      because that’s the point. i don’t just want your body. i want you. all of you. even the parts that get insecure, even the parts that overthink, even the parts that feel like they need to prove something.
      you don’t need to prove anything to me.
      you are already the girl i crave. the girl i think about when i’m bored. the girl i miss when i’m stressed. the girl i want to come home to, and the girl i want to keep close when the world gets heavy.
      so read this again if you need to
      you’re beautiful. you’re sexy and i love you.
      (wtf did i just write)

        i know your chest feels tight right now and your mind is trying to run ahead of you
        
        so let me pull you back for a second
        
        nothing has to be solved in this exact moment
        you don’t need the perfect words
        you don’t need to be strong for me
        you can just be anxious and still be loved
        
        i know life gets messy and scary and sometimes it feels like everything is moving at once
        but even then, despite everything, we still have each other
        we still have us
        and that matters more than your thoughts are letting you feel right now
        
        i’m not going anywhere
        i’m on your side
        i’m with you even if i’m not right next to you
        
        take one slow breath
        read this again if you need to
        you’re safe with me
        we’ll get through this the same way we always do
        together

      hey
      
      i know you’re spiralling a little
      so i’m borrowing your brain for a second
      
      despite everything, we still have each other
      we still have us
      
      you don’t have to fix anything right now
      just breathe and let me be your calm
      
      i’m here
      i love you

      `
      hey darling
      
      if you’re anxious right now, i want you to stop trying to wrestle your thoughts into place
      you don’t have to win a fight in your head to deserve peace
      
      i know it feels like something bad is about to happen, like you have to stay alert
      but you’re allowed to rest
      you’re allowed to let go for a minute
      i’ve got you
      
      even if everything outside feels uncertain, one thing isn’t
      me and you
      we still have each other
      we still have a home in each other, even when the world feels loud
      
      so do this with me
      put your phone down for a second
      loosen your shoulders
      unclench your jaw
      take a slow breath and let it out longer than you took it in
      
      i love you more than your anxiety
      and i’m not leaving
      i’m right here and i love you

      Moon, a hole of light
      Through the big top tent up high
      Here before and after me
      Shinin' down on me
      Moon, tell me if I could
      Send up my heart to you?
      So when I die, which I must do
      Could it shine down here with you?
      'Cause my love is mine, all mine
      My love mine, mine, mine
      Nothing in the world belongs to me
      But my love, mine, all mine, all mine
      My baby here on Earth
      Showed me what my heart was worth
      So when it comes to be my turn
      Could you shine it down here for her?
      'Cause my love is mine, all mine
      My love mine, mine, mine
      Nothing in the world belongs to me
